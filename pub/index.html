Before we publicly launched 
<a href="https://www.beeminder.com" title="Reminders with a sting">Beeminder</a>
in 2011 we committed to deploying and tweeting one 
<a href="http://messymatters.com/uvi" 
   title="Article we wrote about UVIs, including our pitch for why all startups should totally do this">
User-Visible Improvement</a>
to Beeminder per day.
We diligently maintained our average &mdash;
<a href="https://www.beeminder.com/meta/uvi" 
   title="Our Beeminder graph of our UVIs. We don't just eat our own dog food, we stuff ourselves silly with it 24/7.">
enforced by Beeminder</a>
&mdash; for over 2 years before we 
<a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/uvi/#ouch" title="Ouch">
messed up and had to pay</a>
one of our users $1000.
<i>That offer remains very much open.</i>
Go to the 
<a href="http://forum.beeminder.com/t/take-the-beeminder-founders-money/799"
   title="It's a Discourse.org forum and it's where all the cool kids hang out in Beeminderland">
"Take the Beeminder founders' money" thread</a>
in the forum to claim our $1000 if we go off track again!
Despite the one derailment we've continued uninterrupted for 
<span id="n">going on 2500</span>
days (over 6 years!) and counting...

<h3>A Gap???</h3>

From our first public UVI in 2011 through 2014 June 18 we only logged our UVIs by tweeting them
(<a href="http://twitter.com/beemuvi" title="We still do, in case you want follow this Twitter feed and see our daily improvements to Beeminder. For less frequent and generally more interesting announcement, try our main Twitter account, @bmndr.">@beemuvi</a>).
But since we fully expect to outlive Twitter we 
<a href="https://tweets.glitch.me" title="Twitter's export is very slick but it's a bit... twittery">exported everything and are hosting the archive separately</a>
while we gradually convert all that and move it to this page so everything is in one place.
There should be no gap when we're done!

<h3>2015 January - October</h3>

<ol>
<li value="1412">If there was an error submitting credit card info we left the submit button disabled till you refreshed. #bugfix HT <a href="http://dreev.es/eli5">Faire Soule-Reeves</a></li>
<!-- TODO: this was originally #1415 -->
<li value="1413"><strong>We finally actually have a radio button for Do More vs Do Less when creating <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/rescuetime">Rescuetime goals</a>!</strong></li>
<li value="1414">Bugfix in Sleep as Android integration where we might've missed the first day's data after goal creation</li>
<li value="1415">Added a warning to Take A Break about safety buffer caps, w/ link to settings (only applies to premium users who can set safety buffer caps)</li>
<li value="1416"><strong>Beedroid 2.4! New summary widget (so handy!), Buzzing bee animation (so cute!), Better icons (so modern android!), &amp; no less than 7 bugfixes</strong></li>
<li value="1417"><strong>For the full list of changes in version 2.4 of the Beeminder Android app: Settings → About Beeminder → ChangeLog [10 UVIs in 2 tweets!]</strong></li>
<li value="1418">Another improvement to mention in the Beeminder Android app: replaced webview w/ imageview for graphs, meaning it's faster on slower devices</li>
<li value="1419">And a bugfix that was driving at least one of us crazy: if you open the app via a desktop widget you can now task-switch away &amp; back to it</li>
<li value="1420">Gitminder bug (introduced by arbitrary deadlines) where we could skip a day if you had 2 days in a row w/ the same number of commits #bugfix</li>
<li value="1421">Updated our google oauth2 lib but didn't migrate database, so some who used to sign in w/ google couldn't sign in to the Android app #bugfix</li>
<li value="1422">Removed the deadline (due date) info from the goal gallery listing on goals that are finished. (They're no longer due!) #mini (ie, mini UVI)</li>
<li value="1423">Fixed whitespace in bot reminder emails that made format instructions for replying with data needlessly confusing. HT <a href="http://twitter.com/zooko">@zooko</a> #mini</li>
<li value="1424">"Units" placeholder in goal wizard, refresh the graph after stepping down the pledge, linkify "advanced settings" in recent data. #mini ×3</li>
<li value="1425">We were wrongly saying "you've reached your pledge cap" in legit check emails for anyone with a pledge stepdown scheduled. #bugfix</li>
<li value="1426">We were accidentally including withings/fitbit bodyfat goals in our weight loss science experiment. #bugfix</li>
<li value="1427">Not sure it should count since we had to do literally nothing (HT <a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a>) but <strong>we auto-update most user's credit card expiration dates now</strong></li>
<li value="1428">Anti-slopeslipping: this = last UVI we'll count ∀ ongoing improvements to Stripe checkout, Discourse forum, etc where we don't lift a finger</li>
<li value="1429">A self-rate-limiting catch on reminders that suppressed them if the last was &lt;12h ago led to us (rarely) skipping reminders AND zeno #bugfix</li>
<!-- a restriction on reminders that said "don't send reminder if the last reminder was less than 12 hours ago" lead to us skipping reminders AND zeno emails in some eep day cases [pretty rare condition that your last reminder would be less than 12 hours from your previous one, but then total silent failure of notifications on an eep day results] -->
<li value="1430">Fixed <a href="https://twitter.com/PareidoliaX/status/555547027145502720">Quick Add whitespace bug</a> (HT <a href="http://twitter.com/PareidoliaX">@PareidoliaX</a>) which turned out to be idiocy in an undocumented part of our API #bugfix</li>
<li value="1431">Rare failure of legit checks in certain cases where we bcc us humans (eg, high pledge amounts); we caught all cases so far manually. #bugfix</li>
<!-- a legit check would fail if trying to BCC support &amp; "highest_paid" was not yet set. [happened a total of 6 times, and corrected w/in the day for all cases] -->
<li value="1432">Beeminder Android app v2.4.1 fixes freezing after goal creation/deletion &amp; sync progress indicator didn't work on some devices. #bugfix ×2</li>
<li value="1433">Mini UVIs: Link and hovertext on http://duominder.com &amp; added "e.g." to placeholders (people would not notice it was just a placeholder)</li>
<li value="1434">We'd send a scary email about how some new/unknown email address added data to your goal when an admin fixed your emailed data. #bugfix</li>
<li value="1435">Twitter autodata bug: last datapoint traveled forward in time if you hadn't tweeted anything new. HT <a href="http://twitter.com/gedkins">@gdedkins</a> #bugfix</li>
<!-- Led to going from orange => derailed instead of orange => red. -->
<li value="1436">Reminder time &amp; deadline time accept time of day like "2300" now, &amp; error rather than die on bad input. Related to <a href="https://twitter.com/beemuvi/status/537117900004679680">previous UVI</a></li>
<li value="1437">There can be only one (gmailzero goal)! If you try to create 2nd: warning, redirect to existing one (even if archived) HT <a href="http://complice.co">Malcolm Ocean</a></li>
<li value="1438">Got rid of the crufty/confusing "reset road at X" datapoint comments in favor of "DERAILED"; tweaked the comment for PPRs too. #mini</li>
<li value="1439">Oops, we were saying "DERAILED" for restarted goals. <strong>Now meta datapoints are one of {"PESSIMISTIC PRESUMPTION", "RECOMMITTED", "RESTARTED"}.</strong></li>
<li value="1440"><strong>You can now set pledge caps below your current pledge (which take effect when/if you actually drop your pledge to the cap) HT <a href="http://twitter.com/Jolly">@Jolly</a> #alice</strong></li>
<li value="1441">Mini UVIs: smart submit buttons for integrations, labels clickable for pledge cap radio buttons, wording of "reached pledge cap" #mini ×3</li>
<!-- [smart-submit a la https://twitter.com/beemuvi/status/344335764101926912] -->
<li value="1442">Do some actual input validation on "roadall" in the API. HT <a href="http://twitter.com/chipmanaged">@chipmanaged</a> Cf <a href="https://twitter.com/beemuvi/status/513396851031441409">previous UVI</a></li>
<li value="1443">For ppl who'd created gitminder goals before or out of freebees, we were failing to redirect to the goal page after goal creation #bugfix</li>
<li value="1444">Also could fail to ensure you'd auth'd before creating gitminder goal #bugfix. Also <strong>always use fancy landing page layout for goal creation</strong>.</li>
<li value="1445">2 mini UVIs: reworded confusing "extend it first before using retroratchet", added warning re start dates for scheduled breaks. HT <a href="http://twitter.com/aaronpk">@aaronpk</a></li>
<li value="1446">Reminder email was missing link to the goal for goals manually marked as autodata; also <strong><a href="http://beeminder.com/featured">beeminder.com/featured</a> has more goals &amp; sorts better</strong></li>
<!-- [Featured gallery has twice as many goals shown and sorts by most recently added data instead of most recent save] -->
<li value="1447">Ongoing heroic JS refactoring continues to break things. Do More goals created after Odometer goals had spurious initial datapoints #bugfix</li>
<li value="1448"><strong>Beeminder is very proud to be one of a handful of launch partners for the new @Epson #quantifiedself wearables: <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/epson">blog.beeminder.com/epson</a></strong></li>
<li value="1449">We were preemptively trying to create your Withings goal, causing a spurious "couldn't save goal" error immediately after sign-in #bugfix</li>
<!-- ...before you'd actually filled out the form -->
<li value="1450">3 #mini UVIs: added hovertext for Buzz on front page, improved it for integrations, added username to subject of account confirmation emails</li>
<li value="1451">Epson: Fixed date issues that could cause missed activities, time zone issue, &amp; aggregating multiple datapoints for a single day. #bugfix ×3</li>
<!-- [epson dates: fixed an error with start-date in api call for steps endpoint, and to use date of last-fetched activity for the activities endpoint (runsense) - so if you have a lag in updating your data we don't miss any activities.]
     [epson steps/sleep: aggregate the day's data into one datapoint, a la fitbit &amp; jawbone. (this one is questionable since you were the only one to ever encounter it, and i'd have done this from the beginning if i'd actually tested stuff in dev or read the docs more closely)]
     [epson times: use the user's timezone when giving clarifying time-of-day that the event started, or the datapoint was added.] -->
<li value="1452"><strong>Eek! We let you change the road dial on frozen goals, which usually led to insta-derail. Now: force you to use the restart button! #bugfix</strong></li>
<li value="1453">Fixed a passel of glitches with Sleep as Android auth (via Google), confusion with previously issued keys and expiring tokens. #bugfix</li>
<!-- [three things with google auth: tell rails to remember the user before signing them in, update token info on login if it differs from current info (old-style Google auth?), programmatically revoke tokens when removing an authorization] -->
<li value="1454"><strong>Added API documentation for rah, delta, callback_url, description, graphsum, lanewidth, deadline, plotall, etc. HT <a href="http://twitter.com/instigate_it">@instigate_it</a></strong></li>
<li value="1455">Two things in landing pages: consistently hide goal form when showing pledge info, and opaque overlay when showing infinibee. #bugfix ×2</li>
<li value="1456">Mini UVIs: typo fixes in hovertext in settings, fix checkmark symbol in api docs, pruned testimonials, copyright year thing. #mini ×4</li>
<!-- [stop saying the copyright year since that keeps getting out of date] -->
<li value="1457">We weren't alerting you if there were problems with your credit card on premium renewal; now we email an alert, and only retry a few times</li>
<li value="1458"><strong>Much prettier auth page with simple green vs red buttons to confirm/reject. (When you authorize a 3rd-party app; cf <a href="http://beeminder.com/apps">beeminder.com/apps</a>)</strong></li>
<li value="1459"><strong>If you weaselproof yourself you can no longer edit data or add it via the email bot for autodata goals. #closingloopholes HT <a href="http://twitter.com/joeymac1981">@joeymac1981</a></strong></li>
<li value="1460"><strong>In graph hovertext, bot emails, etc, safety buffer now refers to approximate number of days till derailment, not confusingly that minus one</strong></li>
<li value="1461">Consistent grammar/orthography ("beeswax", "e.g., foo" not "e.g. foo", "~N days until" in retroratchet), iOS favicon. HT Nick Head #mini ×4</li>

<li value="1462">Important #bugfix in API's roadall (1 of 3): We were ignoring rate units (runits) for roadall and treating it as if it was always days</li>
<li value="1463">Roadall #bugfix (2 of 3): Discontinuities in the road weren't handled right, led to rejection of road changes that should've been allowed</li>
<li value="1464">Roadall #bugfix (3 of 3): Floating point comparison bug: rejected resubmission of unchanged road matrices! HT <a href="http://twitter.com/instigate_it">@instigate_it</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/chipmanaged">@chipmanaged</a></li>
<li value="1465">Moved list of 3rd party apps you've authorized to access your beeswax (Beeminder data) into user settings so it's actually discoverable now</li>
<li value="1466">Also linked <a href="http://beeminder.com/apps">beeminder.com/apps</a> and <a href="http://beeminder.com/apps/new">beeminder.com/apps/new</a> and <a href="http://beeminder.com/settings/apps">beeminder.com/settings/apps</a> to each other. HT <a href="http://twitter.com/Malcolm_Ocean">@Malcolm_Ocean</a></li>
<li value="1467">Finally there's a button to regenerate your personal auth token in the advanced account settings page (where we show it to you)</li>
<li value="1468"><strong>A new aggday type: triangle. Described in a <a href="http://forum.beeminder.com/t/triangular-beeminding-for-tracking-alcohol-consumption/543">forum thread</a>. Huge HT <a href="http://twitter.com/DRMacIver">@DRMacIver</a>.</strong></li>
<li value="1469">From Jan 30 to Feb 26 HabitRPG goal creation gave cryptic errors in place of graph image at first (tho goal got created) #bugfix</li>
<li value="1470">Explanatory text and visual improvements in <a href="http://beeminder.com/apps">beeminder.com/apps</a>. HT <a href="http://twitter.com/instigate_it">@instigate_it</a> who's been a huge help with API hacking lately.</li>
<li value="1471">Added hint "(Did you mix up auth_token and access_token?)" to an API error message and added two more aggday functions: square and clocky</li>
<!-- TODO: this was originally #1474 and there may be a link to it as such -->
<li value="1472">To catch infinite loops w/ our new (beta only still) IFTTT triggers (or other autodata schemes) there's now a cap of 144 datapoints per day</li>
<li value="1473">Important #bugfix in drawing the graph after a derailment where it could fail to <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/glossary/#flatline">flatline</a> past the derail day</li>
<li value="1474"><strong>Now over-achievers can have every day be an eep day too! (on Do More goals, set 'Max Safety' to 0 just like manual ratchets) #planbeeperqs</strong></li>
<li value="1475">Datapoints + centerline of YBR now show on top of bull's eye. #mini (And so many improvements to Garmin &amp; IFTTT; contact us to beta-test!)</li>
<li value="1476"><strong>Subject lines of legit check emails are now like "paying $X, now pledging $Y on bob/foo: beeminder legitimacy check" (key info up front)</strong></li>
<li value="1477">Fixed the Epson "this data is autogenerated" link: now specifies whether you created goal with Pulsense vs Runsense #mini</li>

<li value="1479">Made the API's create_all call (for adding datapoints) a bit more robust/accepting, as <a href="http://forum.beeminder.com/t/http-500-for-create-all-json/558/2">Bee explains</a></li>

<li value="1482"><strong>Beeminder launches official Garmin integration! <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/garmin">blog.beeminder.com/garmin</a></strong></li>
<li value="1483">Fixed bugs w/ watermarks on graph thumbnails, and maybe now they're bigger and so more readable from the thumbnails (<a href="http://forum.beeminder.com/t/thumbnail-shows-what-looks-like-the-wrong-time/572">forum post</a>)</li>

<li value="1492">Half (or more) of scroll-to-locations in autodata landing pages weren't scroll-to-ing (draftin, codeschool, trello). #bugfix</li>

<li value="1561"><strong>Misfit integration features: beemind amount of sleep or steps. Option to import last month's worth of data when you create the goal.</strong></li>
<li value="1562"><strong>Finally, we use Misfit's push API so Beeminder updates your graph (roughly) as soon you sync your Shine/Flash</strong></li>
<!-- [when/why do you have to refresh on Beeminder? you shouldn't in theory. though i don't know *how* quickly they push data out. There might be a delay? like IFTTT 'automatically' syncs, but you still have to wait 16 minutes] -->
<li value="1563">Have lots of goals/datapoints? Should see up to 50% faster syncs in the Android app (was partly responsible for server issues last week too)</li>
<!-- [api users controller is still one of the slowest transactions, but now the slow calls are ~600ms as opposed to ~3000ms] -->
<li value="1564">Goals w/ deadline after midnight would wind up w/ datapoints off-by-one-day if you re-scaled them (bottom of advanced settings) #bugfix</li>
<li value="1565">The API's roadall was giving a 0 timestamp in the final row instead of null when value and rate (but not goaldate) were specified. #bugfix</li>
<li value="1566">Now the hard cap / bare min numbers show *both* deltas and absolutes; this is kind of terrible but better than previous mess we made</li>
<li value="1567">Small improvement to iOS EEP alerts: "+X due by DEADLINE" (was "by end of day" but that's changeable)</li>
<!-- [these are scheduled based on "Sort Threshold" (see Terrifyingly Advanced settings) but we're deprecating that] -->
<li value="1568">Added a helpful table of upcoming week's worth of Bare Mins (or Hard Caps) to the sidebar of your goal!</li>
<li value="1569">When you choose "hide y-axis" (for people who want to show off their graph but not the numbers) we now suppress the bare min etc numbers too</li>
<li value="1570"><strong>Got rid of most of the confusing baremin/hardcap numbers above graph, since we have the Helpful Table; now just 2 confusing numbers up there</strong></li>
<li value="1571"><strong>Official Skritter integration! <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/skritter">blog.beeminder.com/skritter</a></strong></li>
<li value="1572">Made hard cap / bare min numbers and the table in the sidebar update live when you add new data</li>
<li value="1573">Fixed a confusing bug with the baremin/hardcap table that could cause the values to be nonmonotone if there were upcoming kinks in the road</li>
<li value="1574">New stats in sidebar: both daily and weekly rate (as of today, as opposed to road dial which gives it as of akrasia horizon) plus average rate</li>
<li value="1575">We forgot to respect the user's deadline in the Due By table. Now the listed days are defined to end at whatever your deadline is. #bugfix</li>
<!-- [case for "yesterday" in helpful table: this happens if table is out of date, e.g. just after the day rolls over and before the goal is refreshed.] -->

<!-- [don't error if no color (e.g. goal error or new goal)]
     [chipmanaged asked for the deltas in the title text in case you've already reached the delta.]
     [fixes next_color 500 error] -->
<li value="1578">Last one for now: We color-coded the amounts-due-by (or hard-cap-by) table. Now the new UI should unambiguously dominate the old one!</li>
<li value="1579">Fixed bug in previous "confusing" bugfix that monotonized the table values the wrong way so all upcoming Due Less hard caps were identical</li>
<li value="1580">New API parameter safebump tells you what value you need to reach to get one more day of safety buffer, in the case of Do More goals</li>
    <!-- [for Do Less and weight loss goals safebump is not really meaningful] -->
<li value="1581">Tooltips on Bare Min / Hard Cap section and in the Due By table show up on click and on hover; tooltip explains Due By table</li>
<li value="1582">Bugfix with Due By table and stats: now they always update on new data (before there were some cases where you had to reload the page)</li>
<li value="1583">Copy tweak on graph errors (don't ask you to email support, we automatically do that and come to the rescue) + dumb bugfix w/ Do Less hardcaps</li>
    <!-- [lame because it was a stupid bug and totally my fault, but fixed a bug in do less hardcap section where it was displaying like a stop sign &amp; missing the targets] -->
<li value="1584">Broke Duolingo integration last night working on custom deadlines! Fixed it this morn (and fixed spurious derails; thx for the forbearance!)</li>
<li value="1585">Don't include secret goals (which show up only as masked bee, because secret) in <a href="http://beeminder.com/featured">beeminder.com/featured</a> and warn if you try to set secr. and feat.</li>

<li value="1588">Helpful onboarding widget for newbees! (So you veterans won't see it and only half of newbees will, because bucket-testing) HT @useronboard</li>
<li value="1589">Fixed contrast of tabs/navpills on the sign-up/in modal (when prompted to sign up/in from landing pages). Now you can see there're two tabs.</li>
<li value="1590">Fixed Duolingo redirect (was sending you from Duolingo signup to yr goals after sign-in/up). Also nicely jumps down to the "Ready?" anchor.</li>
<li value="1591">Placeholders use "e.g.," everywhere, or in some cases are just sufficiently bossy as to not be confused with actual data</li>
<li value="1592">No longer allow 'remind' as a goal slug. That's a special route for reminder settings so things broke if you tried to use that name. #bugfix</li>
<li value="1593">Minor #bugfix w/ default y-axis label: lost units when we fixed <a href="https://twitter.com/beemuvi/status/603686534982819843">this pluralization thing</a>. HT @instigate_it</li>
<li value="1594">Can now opt out of weight loss mannequin study. Some people don't like them because of flashing, or because they say they're creepy.</li>
<li value="1595">Our Skritter integration now checks previous 4 days of data so we don't miss any time due to lag betw end of day and all time reflected API</li>
<li value="1596"><strong>Beeminder iPhone app 4.0! (We may've accidentally made it require iOS 8.3 instead of the intended 8.0) Faster, robuster syncing and submitting</strong></li>
<li value="1597">Beeminder iPhone app now shows the amount needed to get an extra day of safety buffer if you're already in the green</li>
<li value="1598">Beeminder iPhone app has multi-column landscape view on iPhone 6 and iPad, and lets you sign in w/ your Google account</li>
<li value="1599">Beeminder iPhone app (4.0) now updates the goal in the gallery immediately after updating the graph</li>
<li value="1600">Beeminder iPhone app has redesigned data entry fields to help ensure correct formatting and are generally easier to use</li>

<li value="1607">New ratelimit-specific error email for IFTTT goals adding too much data. Were sending a generic "bad datapoint" email, which was confusing.</li>
    <!-- [Ratelimit is to protect against infinite loops since we have both IFTTT triggers &amp; actions around adding data] -->
<li value="1608">Beeminder iPhone app v4.1 fixes, we believe, the disappearing goals bug but may have to delete and reinstall (another bugfix version coming!)</li>

    <!-- [we were counting up all the issues closed since midnight, but if the maint check doesn't run until 00:30 and there are additional issues closed btwn 00:00 and 00:30 when maintenance runs, then we'd count them for yesterday, and again tomorrow when we count up issues] -->
<li value="1610">If there was an auth error with your GmailZero token, we were only adding a 0 datapoint, not telling you it's broken. #bugfix</li>
<li value="1611">Rare bug w/ blank pledge caps (involved a double-save on goal setup) caused us not to send legit check #mini #bugfix and emailed ppl affected</li>
    <!-- [all the goals we found were gmailzero goals, but this was not all gmailzero goals.. ~6 of them. looks like something in setup is sometimes causing a double save on create, which had the side effect of clobbering the pledge cap ... fixed it with redundancy in setting the pledge cap, since there should never not be a pledge cap we now set it before_save any time it is blank, instead of once, after create...][also, of the 6 goals w/no pledgecap, only one known instance of the bug because mostly people don't derail] -->

<li value="1614">Oops, inverted which deadlines can be set, which can't #bugfix + We're now consistent in referring to "derailing" rather than "losing" #mini</li>
<li value="1615">Got rid of sadreset in Jawbone, meaning that when you create a new goal and we import your data, you can actually adjust xmin and view it.</li>
<li value="1616">2 RescueTime UVIs today: we had a bug where we didn't let you correct the key if there was a problem. Now we show an error message. #bugfix</li>
<li value="1617"><strong>Second RescueTime improvement: Sub-category minding! Some middle ground btwn minding a specific app and, eg, the entire "Business" category.</strong></li>

    <!-- [We were probably trying to be too clever? now just give the option.] -->
<li value="1619">In "sign up/in" dialog for some of the autodata integrations, the header was giving text specific to Sleep as Android integration. #bugfix</li>

    <!-- [i was lazily throwing the entire message content into the db, which failed to serialize msgs w/ attachments. now we store just the relevant reply params] -->
<li value="1626">Our TagTime integration now understands Beeminder deadlines! (Our TagTime integration is, however, still kludgetastic, involving perl+xterms)</li>
<li value="1627">Now give an error instead of letting you shoot yourself in the foot w/ a custom goal that has both odometer and auto-summing set true. #mini</li>

<li value="1638">The goal progress box in the sidebar is now collapsible, with the Archive button above it instead of inside it. #mini HT Justin Kwok</li>
<li value="1639">Fixed the bug in the API that made the Goal's "datapoints" parameter expect the string "true" instead of the JSON boolean true. #bugfix</li>
<li value="1640">Our Garmin integration was failing on manual activities w/ no distance specified (for goals tracking distance) #bugfix</li>
<li value="1641">If you signed up for Beeminder and didn't fill out a required field or gave a bad email address, etc, we'd barf a 500 error at you. #bugfix</li>
    <!-- [since changing something with Mixpanel] -->
<li value="1642">Our IFTTT datapoint-added trigger sometimes triggered multiple times for same datapoint. #bugfix w/ updating flag for when we last checked</li>
    <!-- [confusion about what exactly the bug was, because seemed like it should have been universal problem, but wasn't] -->
<li value="1643">"Multisport" activities from Garmin were causing duplicate distances to be logged so now we ignore those. HT @notspelledright #bugfix</li>
    <!-- [they send an event with type "MULTI_SPORT" that is the sum total of all the multiple events recorded as part of the multi-sport triathlon training extravaganza. since they also send along each of the different multiple sports as their own stand-alone entries, the multi-sport one should just be ignored] -->
<li value="1644">We messed up grandfathering certain SMS users such that they couldn't update their user info at all (eg, changing a password) #bugfix</li>
    <!-- [only for the subset of ppl who didn't have any active goals with sms reminders on, i think, so maybe pretty inconsequential] -->
<li value="1645">Too many people not understanding the week delay in archiving goals so we made the pop-up pop up when you first press Archive, to explain</li>
    <!-- [we'd previously only had this come up when you clicked Cancel on a pending archive] -->
<li value="1646">If you forget to hit submit on the quick-add form (right side of goal gallery) it now actually warns you. #bugfix Cf <a href="https://twitter.com/beemuvi/status/476413103765073920">previous UVI</a></li>
<li value="1647">Oops, just selecting goal in quick-add box shouldn't trigger the "are you sure you want to navigate away w/out submitting" warning #bugfix</li>
<li value="1648">Another #bugfix: if you tried to submit bad data in quick-add and *then* tried to navigate away, the warning would fail to happen</li>
<li value="1649">We no longer give a 500 error when you specify roadall in the API on a goal currently in an error state (Beebrain). #bugfix HT @chipmanaged</li>
<li value="1650">And on the website, goals in an error state (eg no data) gave an embarrassed bee error (500) if you tried to dial/restart them #mini #bugfix</li>
<li value="1651">Clarified error message and outlined the errored field in red in reset form when you don't give the reset value for the graph #bugfix</li>
    <!-- [occasional error for custom or weight loss restarts from success state. seemed to be unclear, however, given the rate that the error was occurring] -->
<li value="1652">Were accidentally requesting non-https version of useronboard widget which caused warnings, plus conditionally include it cuz faster #bugfix</li>
<li value="1653">Beeminder now uses Habitica's new name and logo! (Previously HabitRPG) Special thanks to @lady_alys</li>
<li value="1654">API now gives permissions error if you try to change the slug (premium only) instead of silent failure #bugfix HT Chris of <a href="http://blog.openendings.net/">blog.openendings.net</a></li>
<li value="1655">Changed the subject lines for zeno polling emails to give the deadline instead of "in 0 days"</li>
<li value="1656">Added a warning and disabled rescaling of graphs with automatic data sources (can't rescale the graph without rescaling incoming data!)</li>
<li value="1657">Fixed broken images after HabitRPG&rarr;Habitica transition. Also updated API docs to mention the daystamp attribute of the Datapoint resource.</li>
<li value="1658">Weaselproofed goals now also don't let you change their data source back to manual. People complained about us letting them weasel that way.</li>
<li value="1659">Yesterday's UVI broke the workaround for changing deadlines on IFTTT/Zapier goals so we fixed that. You can change IFTTT/Zap deadlines now.</li>
<li value="1660">Scootched the gryffin closer in Habitica logo to make collage work. Added daystamps to all Datapoint examples in <a href="http://beeminder.com/api">beeminder.com/api</a> #mini ×2</li>
<li value="1661">Fixes to the "Due By" / "Hard Cap By" table to always use the right heading and "total" vs "value" (for auto-summing or not) as column label</li>
<li value="1662">Deadlines can now be as early as 7am! And added explanation to hopefully mitigate confusion regarding earlybird vs nightowl deadlines.</li>
<li value="1663">RunKeeper goals can now have arbitrary deadlines!</li>
<li value="1664">Added new FAQ item about Rarely Asked Questions, with lots of links to "Beeminder around the internet". <a href="http://beeminder.com/faq">beeminder.com/faq</a> #mini</li>
<li value="1665">The "bare min / hard cap" header above the graph now says the right thing for Rationing goals (metrics you want to go down but not too fast)</li>
<li value="1666">Background job (that checks for Garmin data that failed to push) wasn't checking for valid auth. Caused a few cases of missing data. #bugfix</li>
<li value="1667">Fixed help text tooltip for "Due By / Hard Cap By" table to tailor it for the case of Do Less goals. HT <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100007318037266">David Storrs</a></li>
<li value="1668">We were sometimes getting the date wrong for Duolingo data with non-midnight deadlines when fetched via Beeminder's refresh button. #bugfix</li>
    <!-- [when after midnight for a nightowl deadline, or after the deadline and before midnight for an early bird goal] -->
<li value="1669">Improvements to <a href="http://beeminder.com/overview">beeminder.com/overview</a> like better links, hovertext, explanation of derailment in "How Beeminder works" HT Bill Adams</li>
<li value="1670">Hitting Beeminder's refresh button right after midnight no longer derails you if a fetch from the previous day's still queued up. #bugfix</li>
    <!-- [Fixes the bug where user presses refresh right after midnight to fetch their last data and derails themselves and then we're like "if you'd just waited patiently you would have been fine..", so if the autodata goal was last processed prior to the deadline, then queue this fetch for the previous day's date, and not todays.] -->
<li value="1671">Expose the integery parameter for custom goals (even though it doesn't do much but change how some bare min etc numbers are displayed) #mini</li>
<li value="1672">We now support arbitrary deadlines for Code School goals!</li>
<li value="1673">Added more tooltips in Terrifyingly Advanced Settings. Unclear whether the terror level went up or down. #mini</li>
<li value="1674">Added new Q's to <a href="http://beeminder.com/faq">beeminder.com/faq</a> (blog stuff, integrations) and link to <a href="http://blog.beeminder.com/perverse">blog.beeminder.com/perverse</a> and fixed syntax errors w/ other links</li>
<li value="1675">New IFTTT macro for recipes that send data to Beeminder: PROD[] (as in product, as in multiplying) (<a href="http://forum.beeminder.com/t/ifttt-macros/804">more on the forum</a></li>
<li value="1676">We now support arbitrary deadlines for Trello goals!</li>
<li value="1677">We now support arbitrary deadlines for Withings goals!</li>
<li value="1678">On front page, updated "guaranteed fresh" link, hovertext for that and main navigation links, don't open blog in new tab, and IFTTT macro bugfix</li>
<li value="1679">For goals where we're pretty sure it's measuring time (goal units = "hours") show the recent datapoints as HH:MM:SS not fractional hours</li>
<li value="1680">Moved rate units to basic settings and exposed goal units there (now that we actually use goal units for something)</li>
<li value="1681">Fixed caching of the recent datapoints so if you set your goal units to/from "hours" the time-based display will happen right away #bugfix</li>
<li value="1682">Archiving now happens at the min of {Akrasia horizon, Goal date}. Which also means insta-archive for completed (but not frozen) goals.</li>
<li value="1683">If you derail on the day that your goal is scheduled to archive, the archiving now always happens first (actually just midnight prev night)</li>
    <!-- [used to just do now + AKH, now do floor(now) + AKH, now the archive *def* comes before the derail email on the final day would kick in] -->
<li value="1684"><strong>Reminders Revamp! Huge simplification of reminder settings. Each goal has 3 relevant settings: zeno start time, days lead time, deadline</strong></li>
<li value="1685">Reminders Revamp 2 of N: Now possible to have *only* emergency day alerts (set days lead time to 0, the default), w/o wrong lane alerts too</li>
<li value="1686">Reminders Revamp 3 of N: You now have more control over alerts for Do Less goals (though some confusion remains re: what "safe days" means)</li>
<li value="1687">Reminders Revamp 4 of N: Global defaults for reminder settings! And for each goal you can choose to inherit from defaults or not</li>
<li value="1688">Sort of part of the reminders revamp: we also now have global defaults for pledge cap and for whether to do no-mercy derailments</li>
<li value="1689">Lock icons on pledge cap and no-mercy if they inherit from global defaults (cumbersome but at least no confusion about where to set them)</li>
<li value="1690">Reminders Revamp 5 of N: To turn reminders off altogether: either set alert start time a minute before deadline or set days lead time to -1</li>
<li value="1691">Now using html emails for the alerts (though we're barely taking advantage: links instead of raw URLs, bullets) Also: bugfixes w/ email body</li>
<li value="1692">Reminders Revamp 6 of N: Decoupled beemail from reminders a bit more in that you can say "never" to beemails w/out stopping all reminders</li>
<li value="1693">Reminders Revamp 7 of N: Single setting for SMS vs email (premium only) means less confusion w/ enabling SMS for each goal</li>
<li value="1694">Reminders Revamp 8 of N: The SMS bot now does zeno polling (premium only; grandfathered original SMS users from before we announced this)</li>
<li value="1695">Reminders Revamp 9 of N: Zeno polling start time no longer restricted to 3am-11:59pm. Now anything in the 24 hours pre deadline (sorta).</li>
<li value="1696">Important #bugfix for weightloss/inbox goals where zeno polling would fail to happen if you moved into the red after zeno start time</li>
<li value="1697">Changing your deadline now won't let you insta-derail yourself on an eep day, in addition to not letting you snooze w/in 6 hours #bugfix</li>
<li value="1698">Reminders Revamp 10 of N: Zeno SMS messages now tell you the number of hours left to your deadline</li>
<li value="1699">Autodata vs manual goal reminders had "reply w/ new data" in the subject backwards #bugfix (and briefly broke the "N hours" in subject lines)</li>
<li value="1700">Doh, the defaults weren't getting applied to new goals (was using default defaults instead of adjusted defaults) #bugfix in reminders revamp</li>
<li value="1701">Bug introduced w/ Withings arbitrary deadlines prevented goals from automatically refreshing after getting new data pushed. #bugfix</li>
<li value="1702">Introduced a bug with reminders revamp that made us send you to settings after hitting Retroratchet. Now fixed. #bugfix</li>
<li value="1703">Mini UVIs: made Unsubscribe All button red, better description of SMS perq on premium page, days lead time now enforces range [-1,30]</li>
<li value="1704">One more mini UVI: changed name of tab from "Email" to "Default Settings" since it's not just email anymore (still poorly organized tho!)</li>
<li value="1705">If we fetched new autodata, making you safe, we'd send the Eep! email anyway. And a similar fix for preventing stale eep alerts. #bugfix ×2</li>
    <!-- [if we passed the deadline while running the job, or while it was queued, we'd send the Eep! alert anyway. Skip this too-late alert now.] -->
<li value="1706">Added lifecycle email for newly created goals since reminders revamp means no alerts by default till it's a beemergency</li>
<li value="1707">We had a small bug where we'd sometimes send queued up zeno reminders after the deadline was past and the goal already derailed. #bugfix</li>
<li value="1708">Zeno subject line included 'respond w/ data' for autodata goals instead of manual, and vice versa. #bugfix Also added time to derail to body</li>
<li value="1709">The range for default deadline was (for a while) still enforcing noon-6am after individual deadlines allowed 7am-6am. #bugfix</li>
    <!-- [aka the 10:06am bug.] -->
<li value="1710">Autodata polling could get behind &amp; for non-monotonic ones (eg GmailZero) could fail to start zenoing &amp; thus cause surprise derails #bugfix [and spurious derails addressed]</li>
    <!-- [fix in the autodata polling job: if queues were backed up, and more than an hour passed since the last job. spurious derails addressed.] -->
<li value="1711">In Runkeeper goal creation: 1) actually show error messages to user, 2) for a day or so we gave 500 error trying to create goals #bugfix ×2</li>
    <!-- [fix 500 error from queue-for-refresh on new goals] -->
<li value="1712">Were failing to respect user-set data source. We try to guess if it should be IFTTT or Zapier, but if you change it back we leave it be.</li>
    <!-- [http://forum.beeminder.com/t/ifttt-and-manual-entry-fiasco/720/6?u=dreev] -->
<li value="1713">If you deauthorized Beeminder from Jawbone or something else went wrong we were failing silently instead of throwing up the alert. #bugfix</li>
    <!-- [if the response code is not 200, then the data attribute will be blank, so don't check for that until you've checked for 401 unauthorized or other error codes in the response] -->
<li value="1714">Rare bug (manifested if autodata push failed and had to poll Withings) with not fetching data prior to a "RECOMMITTED" datapoint. #bugfix</li>
    <!-- [now we fetch data since the last non-reset datapoint] -->
<li value="1715">We're now robust to adding stupidly large values like 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 that used to make everything break. #bugfix</li>
<li value="1716">Broke Skritter goal creation: Skritterland requires 4am end-of-day which didn't play nice w/ new default deadlines. #bugfix</li>
<li value="1717">Fixed a rare problem with adding duplicate datapoints submitted by email (related to email retries). Now check message ID to de-dup. #bugfix</li>
<li value="1718">Patch for IFTTT add datapoint TOD (time-of-day) macro to turn 12-hour time of day strings to 24-hour (like add 12 if it's PM... and &lt;12)</li>
