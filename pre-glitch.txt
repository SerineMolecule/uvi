      Yudkowskian anti-akrasia technique when, eg, faced w/ choice of whether to eat a donut: Don't entertain the choice of "just this one" ...
      ... donut. Instead choose between always eating donuts in situations similar to the one you're in (including right now) or never doing so.
. UPD Updates to glossary and FAQ to be up to date with redesign (no panic threshold, etc), nixed superfluous logged in/out banners. #mini++ [TODO: FAQ]
CANDIDATES: --10--------20--------30--------40--------50--------60--------70--------80--------90-------100-------110-------120-------130-------140
    do less max-safety is units too, not days
bugfix: don't try to verify authenticity token on signup or login
? MIS error handling in misfit receive push
? ENC fix encoding issue in dpt controller
? API edits from dave42w on beemapi
. DEA don't let people deauth the smartphone apps [deeper issue here says bee; tried to deal with this the right way but wrong set syntax?]
. LNK Link to make data public/private is wrong with those in advanced [TODO]
. BOT Email bot robustification ("add data above this line") [TODO? not seeing this in production]
. SK2 More serious #bugfix w/ our @SkritterHQ integration: we weren't counting 12am-4am time for the prev day (unless you manually hit refresh?) [TODO: truth check]
      [need to figure out how the bug manifested exactly]
      [origin of bug: it's not a midnight deadline, but also not allowed for the user to set arbitrary deadline]
. BEM beemind.me #bugfix [not a problem on our end? can we fail louder or something?] -- we can maybe give specific error messages
. FEA [TODO: fix bug with /featured, put back "feature me" checkbox, link to it somewhere] [this is not exactly a bug. it's just that we're doing an expensive/dumb fetch-and-sort, so it's not really strictly the exact optimal subset of goals. maybe it's really dumb and it doesn't even closely resemble the right set of goals.]
. HOV TODO: hovertext on pledge amount arrows
o SDP Added a param to sort datapoints in the api goal endpoint (with datapoints=true); should make it [noticeably?] faster in general, since we're no longer sorting by default [need to document it on beeminder.com/api]
. JAW http://forum.beeminder.com/t/bug-weight-logging-through-up/1195 [TODO]
. HMS Elide the trailing ":00" in the H:M:S-formatted values [TODO]
. TRX TODO: improved safebump algorithm: lim(safebuf)
. IS1 [STAGING] ifttt commit: "respond to comparison" https://github.com/dreeves/beeminder/commit/86ba892674fd373a6f050cf13524cb32a3c0ba81
. IS2 [STAGING] ifttt commit: "send comparison with test setup" https://github.com/dreeves/beeminder/commit/55721175aca8bc3f4c5ae26ade2a028927b72d47
. IS3 [STAGING] ifttt commit: ignore specific goal param for deadline IFTTT test (because ifttt requires at least 3 items for a successful trigger. idiots).
. MIN We now give better errors when the email bot can't parse a datapoint [DOH: rachel benoit (hawk3ye/arp) and others have confirmed it's still silently failing]
. DOL make do-less goals re-rail with safety buffer the same way they start with safety buffer. no confusing week of double-steepness. [TODO: happens on recommits, not restarts so far]
. ZAP TODO: handle stuff like this: ^ :29 "Via Zapier-Withings Integration Hack V2" HT Nick Head
TOO LATE OR TOO LAME: --20--------30--------40--------50--------60--------70--------80--------90-------100-------110-------120-------130-------140          
  nuvi 07/29 SETTING PERSISTS ACROSS GOAL CLICKS [i think chelsea said this? referring to togglable buttons for delta vs abs? anything else?]
  nuvi 09/22 remember dashboard toggle state [already tweeted expand/collapse; i think this predated that but don't know what else it might be referring to]
  nuvi 10/04 withings logo [we didn't have one at all before? or was this just referring to the handful of pixels that were cut off originally?]
  nuvi? 7/30 don't barf [was it a 500 before?] if you auth an app on https://www.beeminder.com/settings/apps that is later deleted
       https://twitter.com/beemuvi/status/759646136906883072
  nuvi 10/12 anchor text that goes to the goal tabs, but that’s sort of duplicating what’s on prod [yeah, maybe too minor]
  nuvi 9/23 hide the pledge stepper if autoincrease is off [i don't actually like this]
  nuvi 9/20 smarter default for baremin display (delta vs abs) [too minor? already tweeted togglability. or there's particular cleverness w/ choosing good default?]
o HAB bugfix from alys with initial To-Do count? [not done yet] anything else with api v3 upgrade? [no]
o GTB GTBee infinite loop fix (mongoid thing)
. CAR don't "(premium only)" the goal types that are premium only [slightly less carrot dangling] [not really a UVI, just sneakily concealing carrotiness]
. SCO Stripe checkout everywhere (except premium, and maybe restarting frozen/archived goals?)
. PAN sort threshold bugfix [too lame cuz it's deprecated]
. DUO #bugfix: errors creating new duolingo goals, and others where we set the runits to daily instead of weekly at creation time. [already tweeted fixed rate units]
o EVS "Alert defaults" now has a tooltip about how Email vs SMS is not currently overridable per goal -- you just have to choose one or the other [maybe kind of a negative UVI]
. MIS Misfit bugfix with duplicate datapoints? 
      [i'm still not clear on *how* this happened in the first place]
. SK3 Skritter 4am thing after all? I'm leaning towards no, that we missed our chance to tweet it as part of the "yay! skritter integration" uvi.
o NGI Passenger/nginx thing that bee fixed on saturday 2015 may 9?
. 4AM Handle Skritter's 4am end-of-day properly. (DONE)
. SK3 set returnto for skritter if user not authed yet (?)
o GZ7 Maybe was impossible to create brand new GmailZero goal if coming fresh to http://gmailzero.com and never authed before #bugfix 
      TODO: needs more understanding from Bee but is related to the forum thing: http://forum.beeminder.com/t/breaking-changes-in-gmailzero/713/12
      also maybe improved redirect-after-oauth ridiculousness.. but probably not for everything. 
o PNK API returns "pinkzone" ie subset of the road matrix ("roadall") indicating what part of the road you're not allowed to change [TODO: beebrain only now]
o LAT http://beeminder.com/latestUVIs (maybe we previously had decided this wouldn't count?)
o TMI You can now specify relative deadlines (eg "+2h") in TagTime Minder: http://tminder.meteor.com [BEE VETOES]
. GOO victorious tweet about finally fixing the problem where google would make you re-auth every time or every couple weeks or something? [I did a thing that I hope/wish fixes this, but have not yet confirmed]
. IOS "as far as I can tell there just aren't eep day notifications going out to ios right now" --andy (one prereq for fixing committed so far)
. ??? scrollto failing again for some reason. plus don't remove google oauth at all
. FRE freebees error -- sometimes some people were getting errors? [not actually sure this is fixed yet]
o API goal.frozen? always returns a boolean now [only noticable in ios cuz of causing crashes]
. RK2 runkeeper bug for exactly one user with a non utf-8 character in their runkeeper info [i think it's a legit UVI, being robust to that; but not actually fixed yet?]
. LNK Reminder email link url tweak HT Joel Bradbury
o GRA gravatars, advanced user settings page [dreeves isn't happy with the state of this yet]
- ICO Fixed the icons at http://beeminder.com/services as well
. WEE do an actual shownum on target weight in the mannequin thing [TODO: can we call it uvi if we're not giving mannequin treatment to everyone?]
. DIA fix 500 in dial rate? [saw a commit to that effect...]
o HEA Some very minor tweaks to the frontpage css: got rid of the gradients (the ugly ones anyway), & removed the green dividers between sections
. GIT #bugfix: Gitminder would forget the goal params https://trello.com/c/jdMMpvlt/914-gitminder-forgets-goal-params-if-you-haven-t-already-authed-github [verify not more brokenness]
. CON contact mailer was briefly broken with alice's big refactor or something (was visible to exactly one user so probably doesn't count)
. RES Previous UVI fixed an issue with getting Y-M-D dates for goal fields. We had the same problem in take-a-break and #bugfix'd it too. [prev was aug 31]
. BOC Made the email bot slightly more secure but we don't want to say how cuz it's still embarrassingly lax
. PPO a nice little popover to explain why you can't pledge more than $5 to start with [ OK, it's not actually *all* that nice. right now it just links to money faq ]
. TR5 No special insta-archive option when adding credit card [safe when we add leniency factor for PPRs]
. AVA There was a bug with default avatar thumbnails (the path just pointed to the regular-sized default avatar image) 
. RXR fixed a lazy regex in the revenue graphs to make them more robust to possibility of picking up non revenue entries from the logs (aka we are not billionaires)
. MYL tabs remember your preference for newbee vs advanced data entry [maybe this is super lame, but we didn't mention it yesterday]
. BBR Doubt anyone would've noticed but https://twitter.com/beemuvi/status/361949069003866112 was not accounting for the flatlined datapoint till now
. APP flash error if bad client id for the /apps/authorize thing [TODO for chris]
. GTB Reply to the charge email from GTBee -- http://blog.beeminder.com/gtbee -- w/ "just testing" & we'll cancel it before it goes thru (only works once!)
. BAL For superfans who want to read our whole blog except for things tangential to Beeminder or no longer relevant: http://blog.beeminder.com/tag/bee-all/
. FIN Fine print at the bottom of http://beeminder.com/premium (if you're signed in)
. NIL fix nil comment match error in delete PPR code??? [i have no idea what this is referring to]
o AUT [auto-ratchet? did we ever tweet that?]
- COM API documentation fix: Docs for Datapoint#create_all said "comment" parameter was optional (it's not). HT @dmwit13 [maybe make it actually optional instead?] [this is probably done?]
- QUA Off-by-one bugfix in Quick Add: [what was it?] HT Brent Yorgey <- I'm not really positive this is fixed for all time zones. [this is fixed / will be fixed by daystamp Genmid stuff]
- HOV Hovertext on "Your Goals" link as kind of a reminder that you can share your Beeminder gallery by pointing friends to, eg, http://beeminder.com/d
. IFT new datapoint trigger (a specific goal)
. IFT goal is red trigger (any of your goals, or a specific goal)
. IFT add datapoint action
EMERGENCY UVI IDEAS: ---20--------30--------40--------50--------60--------70--------80--------90-------100-------110-------120-------130-------140
o SET the settings cog should be grayed out instead of absent for frozen goals
o PLC include the pledge cap in the upper left above the graph. and maybe fix those arrow buttons while we're at it.
o API http://forum.beeminder.com/t/api-goal-datapoints-parameter-parsing/1026
      https://github.com/dreeves/beeminder/blob/master/app/controllers/api/v1/goals_controller.rb#L30
o ESY Latest 500 error that chipmanaged generated
o SRT Chelsea: another totally dumb uvi req - sort these alphabetically. http://beeminder.com/services
o PER Don't ask to read the user's email just to sign in with Google
o CHL Chelsea: the popup that comes up when i cancel an archive telling me i'm still on the hook should also pop up when i hit archive initially to say "HEY FYI YOU'RE STILL ON THE HOOK"
o DAY http://forum.beeminder.com/t/days-between-pledges/755 (maybe like a "days since last derailment" line in the goal progress box)
o END get rid of or extend BDUSK in beebrain since rails doesn't have 2038 as ENDOFDAYS anymore
o COO remember_user_token is getting set by rails and causing people to get logged out
o OAU http://beeminder.uservoice.com/forums/3011-general/suggestions/6914639-make-the-oauth2-tokens-non-expiring
o WID http://beeminder.uservoice.com/forums/3011-general/suggestions/6966280-add-widget-code-to-handle-cases-where-iframes-don
o DSE ideas from dsernst:
  * goal page alerts / notifications could use larger X button. More visible and easier to click area 
  * shadow on #goal-box-content doesn't make any sense in terms of real world light.
    * {box-shadow: 0px 0px 3px -1px #3b3b3b;} looks much cleaner 
  * pressing edit button on detailed /datapoints/ page should let you edit values in-line without loading a new page
    * all the relevant data has already been downloaded 
  * Goal graph "Key" is in inconvenient out-of-way position 
  * Goals shouldn't need week delay to archive if they are already completed (or derailed?). Leaves a feeling of being out of control, when unnecessary. 
  * List view for goals, with columns: Name, Time-until-derail, minimum to get on road, pledge amount
o BUG Import["https://www.beeminder.com/api/v1/users/me/goals/bugmagic1623.json?auth_token=xx5h6YWasA29UswMxysm", "JSON"]
o REC ocharles bug with recommit using not-the-most-recent-datapoint value when recommiting an odometer goal
X SMS from lahwran: when you confirm SMS, automatically check the box to actually get minded by sms
o CAL http://beeminder.uservoice.com/forums/3011-general/suggestions/6596906-use-calories-capital-c-for-runkeeper-goals
. KEY https://twitter.com/GameClayton/status/523198750349467648
. FIT fitbit wizard description of different types (reto) [TODO]
? ??? [alice will probably get to writing this up properly soon, once the reunion is over] https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?zx=ugrzciuivp11#inbox/1456df0ec713c804
. CNT Fixed flaky countdown timer; it should always refresh itself now when new data is entered or the road is dialed. #bugfix HT @drmaciver [TODO: still flaking out as of july 6 2am]
. SHP checkbox to show password [dreevpeeve]  [TODO]
. ESW http://beeminder.uservoice.com/forums/3011-general/suggestions/5823296-enforce-current-weight-field-when-setting-goal [TODO]
. FRE bug that allows people to create pledgeless goals when out of freebees [TODO]
. QUI make it more obvious that "quick add" is not so much for newbees  [TODO]
. GTY goal type selector updates the description text as you mouse over the goal type in drop down. [TODO]
. TOT and it tells you how many total datapoints there are uptop on the datapoint page [removed till it's prettier]
. ALL option to count all commits to a repository for gitminder (rather than only commits by you) [i should make this something the user can set before we tweet it]

(tip: just type it all out in a couple full sentences first and then we can tighten it down to 140; don't be vague like "fixed retroratchet" except as temporary placeholder)

Solving the discrepancy in UVI numbering:

DONE: change 2017-04-05 datapoint from 2->1
  which changes bmndr#2245 -> 2244
  and decrements all subsequent bmndr numbers
DONE: change glit#1412 -> 1411 and decrement all subsequent glitch numbers
DONE: tweet missing tweet, UVI#2055
