See index.html for the background about User-Visible Improvements (UVIs).

Goals for this Glitch app:

1. A numbered list of all 2252+ UVIs, with date and link to the corresponding tweet.
2. An easy way to add new UVIs.

Initially we'll do #2 by just manually tweeting each UVI and also pasting it into this Glitch app as well.

It might not be worth trying to duplicate Twitter's interface and automatically tweeting. There are too many things like expanding @-mentions and telling you how many characters you have left (accounting for shortened URLs) that wouldn't work as well outside of Twitter.

So maybe it could be the other way around: automatically fetch new @beemuvi tweets and ... I'm not sure yet. But let's first worry about goal #1.

Also it would be nice if it were easy to totally migrate away from Twitter in the future if we wanted to.

## TODO LIST

1. Better CSS so it doesn't look so ugly (Bootstrap?)
2. Link to jump to the bottom
