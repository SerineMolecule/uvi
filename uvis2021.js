Set API to be json only

2021-11-17: email warning sent to people
2022-01-01: TODO: run the rake task to actually raise the prices on people
this is a rake task for doing the actual database update to change folks from $32 nominal beemium price to $40 nominal beemium price.
once this is deployed i'll run a test run of the task, and assuming that's all smooth, this can be ignored until January first.

* Friendlier oauth names: https://github.com/beeminder/beeminder/issues/1612
* CNR on this weight-loss restart thing means maybe we fixed it long ago without realizing it? https://github.com/beeminder/beeminder/issues/1321
* fixed timeouts in jsbrain_server? https://github.com/beeminder/road/issues/51 -- depl'd probably 2020 october or earlier
* milk static-401 for more uvis? (fixing/obviating the banner bug, making it all work the same via the API)
* fixed some (most? many?) of the thing where flash banner shows up again after you leave current page & go to another page [maybe mostly only happens for admins?]
* Vimium users can now jump to the goals on the dashboard with hotkeys. something about octicons apparently?
* max-height for the landing page images, same commit url as an old one from a previous UVI about runkeeper:
  https://github.com/beeminder/beeminder/commit/94e269275c4a02a1e12c5c28c42e2faef23205b3
* Got rid of the \"Increase the pledge each time you derail\" checkbox on the goal page as it was redundant with using Pledge Caps to stop pledge increases
  [BEE: nothing was tweeted as far I can see; but also you don't have a PR/Gissue to link to with this, so maybe that + the ancientness disqualifies it?]
